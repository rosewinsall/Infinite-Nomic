(Striked through rules are indented as this file does not support striking text)

- **Rule 6:**
Every time a rule (which is numbered with a number that can be divided by 10 without resulting in a number with decimals) is added to #official-rules, all active players are given a TripleVote. A TripleVote can be used by telling a @Moderator, and upon being used, the next vote of the player whose TripleVote was used, counts as 3 votes. 


- **Rule 7:**
After a player's proposal passes, they receive 40 Coins.


- **Rule 9:**
Whenever a proposal is accepted (adding of a rule, removal of a rule or ammendment of a rule), all the players who voted *against* the proposal receive 10 Coins.


- **Rule 10:**
The players have the option to start a debate. A debate is a time period of 24 hours where people argue for or against the initial argument. For example: "debate: chem trails make frogs gay". Then, people argue for or against it. When the 24 hours are up, people will have new insight concerning both sides, and thus vote for a side. The winners' side will be rewarded 50 Coins to each player who participated, and the losers side will be rewarded 20 (for participation). However, to avoid side switching, I suggest not creating a poll, but rather messaging a mod with the side the player sided with. The debates may be about anything. The debate needs 4 or more participants before the 24 hour time period is over, or else voting won't commence. To qualify as a participant you need to come with at least 1 argument. An argument may be as little as the player simply disagreeing, but the player will need to have some sort of counter-argument. For example: "argument: chem trails doesnt make the frogs gay. What're your sources?" could be a counter argument.

- **Rule 14:**
If a player has 100 Coins or more they have the option of attempting to bribe another player to vote the same as the bribing player on a rule vote. If the potential bribed player accepts the bribe they will gain 100 Coins and the briber will lose 100 Coins.

- **Rule 16:**
You may consume (gain -1) balloon. If you do, move to the first position in the "Next" section of the turn order listed in #turns. Consuming balloons in such a fashion can be done by pinging a @Moderator in the #nomic-discussion channel, and specifically requesting to consume a balloon to "move to the top of the turns order".
You cannot have a negative value of balloons.
EDIT: If a person takes 3 turns without a turn of another person between those turns then their next turn will be skipped.


- **Rule 17: Economy**
All players who have a negative amount of points immediately have 100 points when this proposal passes. 

Everyone lose all their TripleVotes and balloons. Rule 15 is removed from the game by getting a strikethrough. 
Balloons and TripleVotes will still be a thing, but they can be achieved in new ways (see paragraph 12 of this rule). 

The game word "points" will hereby be reffered to as "Coins" instead. 
 
A new channel will be added to the server when this proposal passes, called #shop. Only people with the @Moderator or @Merchant roles can write in this channel. The channel will be an overview of all items it is possible to buy in the game. 

Proposals can define a new item that is added to the #shop. Proposing a new #shop item must include these three things: an item name, a price for buying it, an amount of the item that will be put into the #shop, and an effect the item has upon being used (consuming an owned item can be done by messaging a @Moderator). 
Once such a proposal passes, a @Moderator or a @Merchant will add it to the list of #shop items, using this template: 
[Name]
Cost: [Cost] 
In stock: [Quantity] 
Effect: [Effect]
Each time an item is bought, the item's number in the "in stock" section is decreased by 1. An item can not be bought if this number is lower than 1. 

When this proposal passes, an election will happen where a @Merchant is chosen (someone @Inactive can never be a @Merchant. If the @Merchant becomes inactive or loses the Merchant role in any other way, a new election will be initiated). 

When a new item is proposed, the @Merchant will vote in place of the @Leader. 
Judges are not allowed to vote "Nay" on #shop item proposals. 


If a player wishes to buy something from the #shop, they may choose to message a @Merchant publicly saying explicitly that they wish to buy an item, including the name of the bought item. It is impossible to buy an item if the player does not have an amount of Coins equal to or greater than the price of the requested item, except if the item's description states otherwise. 

All Coins that are spent on buying items from the #shop are not simply removed from the game - they are instead put into the Bank (a section in #shop showing an amount of Coins). This action will be performed by the @Merchant. 


- **Rule 18:**
You may become inactive whenever you like by using the command !inactive. While you are Inactive, if you would like to become active again, you can use the command !active to remove the Inactive role.


- **Rule 19: Vassals & Lords**
Effective with this rule, each player gains a property, Allegiance, that is initially set to “Free.”

A player (hereafter “the vassal”) may swear themselves to another player (hereafter “the lord”) if the lord assents. To do so, the vassal and the lord each message a moderator indicating their intentions, whereupon the vassal’s Allegiance becomes “Lord <lord’s nickname>.” (e.g. “Lord Raven James”)

A vassal may only have one lord, but a lord may have any number of vassals.

In this allegiance, the lord gains coin, while the vassal gains clout. When a vassal makes a proposal that goes to an open vote, the lord must vote there in favor of the proposal. When a vassal gains coins, they must give one tenth of those coins, rounded up, to their lord.

Either player may unilaterally annul the allegiance by (a) failing to perform their duty of allegiance or (b) messaging a moderator indicating their intent. In addition to these, the vassal may annul the allegiance by swearing allegiance to new lord.


- **Rule 20:**
If a player spots an unconstitutional incident and notifies players on #nomic-discussion  about it, specifying the specific parts of the rules that make it unconstitutional, he/she gains 150 points if what he specified is deemed unconstitutional by a @Moderator . 

If a player makes an action while it is deemed unconstitutional, he/she loses 150 points.
Deeming an incident as unconstitutional is made after 3 people, including at least 1 @Moderator agree that the specified incident is unconstitutional.

Modifying a rule that an action is related to, triggers a "constitutional check". A constitutional check, is checking if a previously-related-to-an-unconsitutional-incident-but-now-modified rule can still trigger the unconstitutional incident. If it doesn't, the action is no longer deemed as unconstitutional.

- **Rule 21:**
Every Monday when a @Moderator updates the game (currently 17:00 CET), every player loses 40 (?) Coins each. If they have fewer than 40 Coins when tax is to be collected this day, they will instead lose all their Coins be put at the bottom of the "Next" section of #turns. All Coins collected because of this rule are added to the "Bank" section in #shop by a @Merchant.

- **Rule 22: Redistribution of wealth:**
Every Tuesday, when a @Moderator updates the game, 10% of the coins currently in the bank (rounded up), are split equally among every active player who does not have the most amount of coins.
Any coins that cannot be split equally, return to the bank

For example, 3 active players on a Tuesday with 185 gold in the bank: 19 coins would be split among the 2 active players with the least amount of money. However, since we cannot have half a coin, each of these 2 players gets 9 coins and the bank loses 18 coins to a new total of 167 gold.
If 2 or more players tie for the highest amount of coins, none of these players would get any coins.

- **Rule 23:**
Proposals have ID numbers. Whenever a player submits a proposal to #proposals, they shall label it with its ID number. Each proposal's ID number is the last proposal's ID number plus one.

- **Rule 25:**
Players can, if they believe that they have found a mistake in one of the gamestate tracking channels, submit an erratum to #errata. The player who maintains that channel shall either accept the erratum and fix the incorrect portion or deny it. After an erratum is accepted, the player who posted it gains 5 coins. The player who maintains a channel cannot submit errata about that channel.

Players cannot file errata about github documents.

- **Rule 26:**
Any @Current player who is not a @Merchant may forgo their proposal and request a loan from the bank instead, equal to or less than the current amount of coins in the bank, or less than 200 coins, whichever is less. If they do, the @Merchant can choose to approve or deny the loan within 24 hours of that player's request. If they deny the loan, nothing happens and the turn of the player who requested the loan is skipped. If the loan is approved, the amount of coins specified is removed from the banked, and the player who requested the coins adds that amount of coins to their balance. This is not considered as "gaining coins" for other rules. The player gains a loan value in the inventory equal to the amount of coins he got from the bank, is considered a "debtor" and gets the according role for as long as he has a non-zero loan value.

Any player who has a loan value, may request to pay back their loan at any time, by pinging an @Merchant in the nomic discussion channel and specifying what amount of their current loan they want to pay back. The amount of coins specified is removed from their current coin balance and their loan value.

Every Friday at announcement time, every player's loan value becomes 1.1 times their current loan value.

If a player's loan value exceeds 500, the bank gains coins equal to that player's coin value, that player's coin and loan values become 0, they lose the game, they become a "slave" and get the according role.


-**Rule 27:** 

Once a day, a player may do a single Feudal Action. A player can choose to do a second Feudal Action on the same day by spending 10 coins.
Feudal Actions can be created, amended, and repealed just like regular rules, however all Feudal Actions are listed in a github document titled "Feudal-Actions". 

- **Rule 28:** 
Any current player may forgo submitting a proposal submit to instead attempt to pickpocket from another player. 

The pickpocketting player submits a name to a mod as their target.  The target chosen must have more than 50 coins. 

To succeed in pickpocketting the @Current player pickpocketting rolls a number between 1 and 10. If a number greater than 7 is rolled, the pickpocket attempt is a success and 7 coins are transferred from the target's coin amount to the coin amount of the pickpocketter. 

If a pickpocket attempt fails, the @Current player pickpocketting loses 10% of their coins as punishment. This lost money is sent to the bank

- **Rule 29:** 
To transfer coins or items from one player to another is for one player to lose the coins or items (as specified) and the other player to gain the same amount. If a transfer would cause a player to lose more items or coins than they have, the transfer does not occur.

A player may, at any time, offer a Trade with another player. This may be done publicly, or in a Discord DM. The terms of a Trade may include the transfer of coins and items, as well as agreements as to future game actions by either player, and fines (as a number of coins) for violation of any agreements.

The other player may then agree to the trade (publicly, even if the initial offer was private); in doing so, they must list any transferred coins and items, but need not list other terms of the trade. Upon agreement to the trade, the specified transfers occur.

- **Rule 30:**
No player can earn more than 100 coins per turn. If a player's total amount of money earned in the day Redistribution of Wealth triggers exceeds 100, gaining money due to that rule takes precedence over other effects.

The Redistribution of wealth bit is so that we don't lose track of the amount of money in the bank
